# Express React JS

A template repo for a server side rendered node.js web app using express and react for views

Additional aspects:
  - Bulma for css+sass but easily replaceable 
  - Babel for nextgen js in the browser, typescript for type checking only (no emit/compile) 
  - JSX composable views
  - Webpack for client side js and css
  - Inner loop including unit tests (TODO)
  - E2E tests (TODO)
  - Containers and K8s deploys (TODO)
